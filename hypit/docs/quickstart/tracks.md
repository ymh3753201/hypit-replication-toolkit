title: Tracks
description: Peer track components — captions, media, typography and authored audio.
---

Every audiovisual contribution entering the final composition is a peer **Track**. Tracks are flat
(no nesting), and visual z-order is determined by the `stack-order` property in SVS. This page
covers Caption, Media, Typography and Audio Track authoring.

## Caption system

Caption uses a Script-owned document and a replaceable Style family:

```text
Script CaptionDocument + Timeline → complete timed Cues → Use presentation
```

```svml
<import as="caption" from="@hypit/caption@1"/>
<import as="caption-fine" from="@hypit/caption-fine@1"/>
<import as="media" from="@hypit/media@1"/>
<import as="fonts" from="@hypit/fonts-open@1"/>
```

`@hypit/caption` owns the common CaptionDocument contract, complete-unit Selection/Role projection,
Style assignment and the timing join. `@hypit/caption-fine` is one Style family: it owns geometry,
glyph/Cue/Pill Paint and layered local motion.

### caption-fine:Style

A Style is a rendering intent resolved from one package-owned SVS Recipe:

```svs
caption.primary {
  stack-order: 70; x: 0.5; y: 0.88; width: 0.84;
  height: 0.22;
  anchor-x: center; anchor-y: bottom;
  size: 58;
  line-height: 0.96; letter-spacing: -0.5; word-gap: 14;
  align: center; block-align: end; inline-size: fixed;
  wrap: word; max-lines: 2; max-words-per-line: 4;
  direction: ltr;
  fill: #FFFFFF; opacity: 1;
  stroke-color: #09090B; stroke-width: 2;
  shadow-color: #000000; shadow-opacity: 0.72;
  shadow-x: 0; shadow-y: 3; shadow-blur: 8;
  glow-color: #FFFFFF; glow-opacity: 0.12; glow-blur: 8;
  gradient-from: #FFFFFF; gradient-to: #93C5FD; gradient-angle: 120;
  long-shadow-color: #111827; long-shadow-opacity: 0.35;
  long-shadow-distance: 8; long-shadow-angle: 45;
  background: #09090BCC; border-color: #FFFFFF20; border-width: 1;
  padding: 16 24; radius: 18;
  karaoke: trail; karaoke-transition: wipe;
  active-fill: #FFD54A;
  active-box: current; active-box-continuity: isolated;
  active-box-background: #FFD54ACC; active-box-padding: 4 8; active-box-radius: 8;
  active-underline: current; active-underline-color: #FFFFFF;
  active-underline-thickness: 3; active-underline-offset: 5;
  cue-enter: spring; cue-enter-frames: 4;
  cue-enter-start-scale: 0.75;
  cue-exit: none; cue-exit-frames: 0;
  atom-reveal: all;
  active-response: pop; active-response-frames: 5; active-scale: 1.08;
  lead-frames: 4; tail-frames: 4; handoff: cut;
}
```

```svml
<fonts:Stack id="caption-fonts" family="inter" weight="700" style="normal" emoji="color">
  <fonts:Fallback family="noto-sans-sc" weight="700" style="normal"/>
</fonts:Stack>
<caption-fine:Style id="primary-caption" recipe={recipes.caption.primary}
  font={caption-fonts}/>
```

The required `font=` edge carries one byte-reproducible `FontStackRef`. Family, weight and style
exist only on that edge; each fallback retains its own exact face metadata. Fine rejects a Style
without that stack instead of falling back to machine fonts.

Another Caption package may define a different rendering family without changing the common
CaptionDocument contract.

Fine's properties are orthogonal: normalized placement and anchor; layout and
typography; base/active solid or gradient glyph Paint; stroke, shadow, directional long shadow,
glow and underline; Cue/Pill Paint; three independent glyph/Pill/underline activation channels;
and layered Cue, Alignment-Unit, active-response and loop motion. Missing optional dimensions resolve
deterministically to no decoration or motion. Unknown properties are rejected.

The package groups those properties as **Where**, **How** and **When** in its Surface declaration,
so Studio can present the same author contract without maintaining a Caption-specific property list.
`lead-frames` and `tail-frames` form an explicit visible Schedule around the spoken Cue;
`handoff: cut` prevents adjacent visible envelopes from competing, while `overlap` preserves both.
Neither form changes the Word frames used by Karaoke.

`karaoke` is `off`, `current` or `trail`; `karaoke-transition` is `step` or `wipe`. Timing is always
whole-Alignment-Unit timing already proven by Caption. A normal one-word unit therefore highlights
per word, while a Dual Text unit remains one indivisible visible unit. Fine never guesses internal
time.

`active-box` is independently `off`, `current` or `trail`. `active-box-continuity: isolated` paints
one capsule per activated Alignment Unit; `joined` turns a trail into one ordered prefix whose background is
continuous on each real browser line. Thus trail-colored text with a current-only Pill is one
Recipe—not a second renderer.

With `wrap: word`, Fine wraps between complete Alignment Units and falls back inside a single
over-wide display unit so it cannot escape the Region. `max-words-per-line` constructs explicit rows;
when `max-lines` is present, a Cue that would construct more rows is rejected instead of having its
text or Paint clipped. Cue boundaries come from Script segments, turns and authored
`||`.

Fine is the uniform-flow family: every token follows the same Recipe and may differ only by time,
index or play state. A Cue with authored internal roles—different font/layout groups, full-frame
inversion, tearing or cross-clause composition—requires another Caption package rather than a hidden
Fine exception.

CJK dialogue can be written directly. For a display-only emoji that still follows speech timing,
author the correspondence explicitly, such as `<🌐 | globe>`; the system will not invent a spoken
word for a bare symbol.

### caption-fine:Track

Caption content comes from Script and Timeline. Uses choose presentation in time; later Uses replace earlier treatments inside their windows, including Hidden.

```svml
<caption:Hidden id="hidden"/>
<caption-fine:Track id="captions" document={story.caption} timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <caption-fine:Use style={primary-caption}/>
  <caption-fine:Use role="ALICE" style={alice-caption}/>
  <caption-fine:Use role="BOB" style={bob-caption}/>
  <caption-fine:Use during={story.selection.product-demo} style={dialogue-caption}/>
  <caption-fine:Use during={story.selection.private} style={hidden}/>
</caption-fine:Track>
```

`||` organizes Cues. A window can start inside a Cue while retaining its complete text and original word timing. `role` filters the speaker independently of time. `at`/`for`, `until`/`for` and `start`/`end` use the same time language as other tracks.

## Media overlays and B-roll

B-roll is an editorial use of the generic Media Track, not a separate Track family. One Item can
place an image, generated video, prepared timed medium or compositable Surface at a semantic or
absolute window.

```svml
<import as="media-track" from="@hypit/media-track@1"/>
<import as="wording" from="@hypit/text@1"/>
```

### media-track:Track and media-track:Item

Placement is an explicit Spatial Frame edge; appearance and motion remain reusable SVS values.

```svml
<wording:Value id="product-direction">
  A clean vertical product film: the written script becomes semantic regions,
  then those regions assemble into a finished video.
</wording:Value>

<seedance:ReferenceVideo id="product-motion" model="mini"
  prompt={product-direction} duration="5">
  <seedance:Reference image={product-reference} person-reference="false"/>
</seedance:ReferenceVideo>

<space:Frame id="product-frame" within={vertical}
  left="8%" top="20%" right="92%" bottom="68%"/>

<pipeline:Normalize id="product-media" source={product-motion.video}
  video="primary-moving" audio="none" span-authority="video" frame-rate="30"/>

<media-track:Track id="product-broll" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical}>
  <media-track:Item media={product-media.media} frame={product-frame}
    during={story.selection.product-demo}
    appearance={recipes.media.product}
    motion={recipes.motion.product}/>
</media-track:Track>
```

`left`, `top`, `right` and `bottom` are edge coordinates inside the parent Frame; `right` and
`bottom` are not CSS-style margins. A Frame covering the middle 84% of the canvas horizontally is
`left="8%" right="92%"`, and `right="8%"` would place its right edge to the left of its left edge,
which is rejected. The Selection contributes semantic points; Media performs the package-owned
window projection.
The same Item model also covers full-canvas cutaways, split screens and corner overlays. Ordered
child layers, source occupancy and explicit Sequences are available when one source is not enough.

Every Item, Member or sample Layer declares exactly one visual input form:

| Input | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `image={...}` + `extent={...}` | Blob + authored pixel extent | A durationless still image |
| `media={...}` | `SynchronizedMedia` | Connect an explicitly prepared timed source directly |
| `surface={...}` | `CompositableSurfaceRef` | Connect an alpha-aware still or timed surface directly |

A generated or imported video Blob reaches a Track through `<pipeline:Normalize>`, which inspects it,
selects its streams and puts them on one frame domain; its `.media` output is what `media=` connects
to. `audio="none"` carries the picture alone, and `audio="default"` carries the source's own sound,
which `audio-gain` then scales. These forms are explicit so a generic Blob is never guessed to be an
image or a video.

**Outputs:** `{product-broll.visual}` and, only when explicitly authored, `{product-broll.audio}`.

## Audio tracks

`@hypit/audio-track` places explicitly prepared audio on the same Timeline as the visual
Tracks. An `Item` consumes `SynchronizedMedia`; normalize a declared or generated audio Blob first,
then choose its exact program window and occupancy:

```svml
<import as="media" from="@hypit/media@1"/>
<import as="pipeline" from="@hypit/media-pipeline@1"/>
<import as="audio" from="@hypit/audio-track@1"/>

<media:Audio id="music" src="./assets/music.wav"/>
<pipeline:Normalize id="music-media" source={music}
  video="none" audio="default" span-authority="audio" frame-rate="30"/>

<audio:Track id="music-bed" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <audio:Item source={music-media.media} during="program"
    playback="loop-end" gain="0.28" fade-in="600ms" fade-out="800ms"/>
</audio:Track>
```

| Attribute | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Track.id` | yes | Stable Audio Track identity |
| `Track.timeline` | yes | Timeline that defines the exact sample and frame domain |
| `Item.source` | yes | Explicitly selected and normalized `SynchronizedMedia` |
| `during`, `at`/`for`, or `start`/`end` | exactly one form | Whole-program, Selection, Moment, or explicit window |
| `playback` | no | `once`, `once-end`, `loop`, `loop-end`, or bounded `stretch` |
| `trim-start`, `trim-end` | no | Exact source trim |
| `gain`, `fade-in`, `fade-out` | no | Explicit per-item mix values |

The package performs no automatic extraction, normalization, ducking, or bus routing. Multiple
Items in one Track and multiple peer Audio Tracks remain independent inputs to Film. The output is
`{music-bed.audio}`, an ordinary `AudioTrack`.

## Text overlays

Static or timed text displayed on screen — titles, callouts, lower thirds.

```svml
<import as="text" from="@hypit/typography-track@1"/>
<import as="wording" from="@hypit/text@1"/>
```

### text:Track

Container for text items.

```svml
<space:Canvas id="vertical" width="1080" height="1920"/>
<space:Frame id="title-frame" within={vertical}
  left="6%" top="6%" right="94%" bottom="16%"/>
<fonts:Stack id="title-font" family="inter" weight="900" style="normal"/>
<text:Style id="title-style" recipe={recipes.text.title} font={title-font}/>
<text:Track id="titles" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <text:Area id="title" placement={title-frame} style={title-style} during="program">
    EDIT MEANING, NOT TIMELINES
  </text:Area>
</text:Track>
```

| Attribute | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Unique identifier |
| `semantic` | yes | Timeline from `time:Timeline` — also resolves Selection-based item timing |

### text:Point, text:Area and text:Path

Each item has one explicit placement form, one exact Style and one temporal projection. `Area`
places flowing text inside a `SpatialFrame`:

```svml
<text:Area id="meaning" placement={title-frame} style={title-style} during="program">
  MEANING
</text:Area>
```

| Attribute | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Stable item identity |
| child content or `content` | yes | Inline plain/rich content, or an ordinary graph `Text` reference; the two forms are exclusive |
| `during` | yes | `"program"` or a Selection reference; `at` and explicit `start`/`end` are also available |
| `placement` | yes | `SpatialPoint`, `SpatialFrame` or `SpatialPath`, matching the item form |
| `style` | yes | A `text:Style` compiled from an SVS Recipe plus exact font bytes |

The `during` attribute accepts the literal string `"program"` for the complete Timeline,
or a Selection or Segment reference for semantic timing. The same temporal interface also accepts
authored `start`/`end` windows and `at`/`for` events:

```svml
<text:Style id="callout-style" recipe={recipes.text.callout} font={title-font}/>
<text:Track id="callout" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <text:Area id="callout-copy" placement={callout-frame}
    style={callout-style} during={story.selection.callout}>
    EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT
  </text:Area>
</text:Track>
```

Graph-produced copy remains visible as an edge:

```svml
<wording:Value id="headline">EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT</wording:Value>
<text:Track id="callout" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <text:Area id="callout-copy" content={headline}
    placement={callout-frame} style={callout-style} during="program"/>
</text:Track>
```

The generic Text value supplies only characters. Typography still owns the item document wrapper,
placement, timing, style and motion. Use inline `P`/`Span`/`Break` when the author needs rich runs.

**Output:** `{titles.track}` — a VisualTrack added to `film:Film`.

## Ranking boards

A ranking board animates an ordered list against the Script. The concrete container, item and Style
vocabulary is package-owned; inspect the installed package before authoring it.

| Container | Item | Style |
|---|---|---|
| `ranking:Column` | `ranking:ColumnItem` | `ranking:ColumnStyle` |
| `ranking:TopThree` | `ranking:TopThreeItem` | `ranking:TopThreeStyle` |

```svml
<import as="ranking" from="@hypit/ranking@1"/>
```

### The style tag

Empty, and all three attributes required: `id`, `recipe` (an SVS Recipe) and `font` (a Font Stack or
Font artifact). The recipe is validated against the selected component variant; a Recipe from another
family is refused by name.

### The container tag

| Attribute | Takes |
|---|---|
| `semantic` | the Timeline the board is timed against |
| `frame` | a `space:Frame` — the board's declared placement |
| `during` | the timing form declared by the selected component |
| `style` | the matching style record, and only that variant's |
| `appear-sound`, `move-sound` | optional Synchronized Media |
| `terminal` | the Moment where the completed board settles. `TopThree` only |
| `canvas` | an optional `space:Canvas` declared by the selected component |

Use only the timing forms admitted by the selected package; do not infer a terminal or reveal model
from another component family.

Optional sounds and reveal phases are valid only when the selected package declares them.

### The item tags

Each variant takes its own, at least one, and ids must be unique within a board.

- **`TopThreeItem`** — `label` and item-owned Moment `at` are required; `icon` and `stack` are optional.
  At most three. TopThree reveal order comes from these Moments' actual frame order.
- **`ColumnItem`** — `label` (required) and `rank` (required, a positive integer that decides the
  numbered row and nothing else), optional `icon` and `stack`. Each item also owns its reveal time:
  `during` names a Selection whose projected window is when it prefers to appear, and
  `preset="true"` marks a row that starts already placed. Exactly one of the two — an item with
  neither, or with both, is refused by name.

```svml
<ranking:ColumnStyle id="board-style" recipe={recipes.ranking.board} font={ui-font}/>
<ranking:Column id="board" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical} frame={board-frame}
  during={story.selection.board} style={board-style}>
  <ranking:ColumnItem id="row-regen" rank="1" label="ReGen" icon={icon-regen}
    during={story.selection.regen-reveal}/>
  <ranking:ColumnItem id="row-chatgpt" rank="2" label="ChatGPT" icon={icon-chatgpt}
    during={story.selection.chatgpt-reveal}/>
  <ranking:ColumnItem id="row-remini" rank="3" preset="true" label="Remini" icon={icon-remini}/>
</ranking:Column>
```

**Output:** `{board.visual}` — a VisualTrack. A board given a sound also exports `{board.audio}`, an
AudioTrack; without one there is no audio output to add.

## Card decks

A deck holds cards in depth: one is in front, the others recede behind it, and each new card is dealt
on a Moment. Where a Media Item places one shot in one Frame, a deck keeps a stack of them in the
same Frame and moves the whole stack.

```svml
<import as="deck" from="@hypit/deck-track@1"/>
```

### deck:DepthStack

`id`, `timeline`, `canvas`, `frame` and `appearance` are required. The same Timeline supplies authored
times and any placed semantic anchors. `until` says
what ends the deck: a Moment, a Selection or Segment boundary, or an authored time such as `8s`.
With a Selection or Segment, `until-boundary="start" | "end"` chooses its edge; the default is `end`.

### deck:Card

A direct child of the stack, self-closing, at least one, and dealt in document order.

| Attribute | Takes |
|---|---|
| `source` | required — a still image, a Synchronized Medium, or a Compositable Surface |
| `extent` | required for a still image and refused for anything else |
| `at` | required — the reveal event: a Moment or an authored time such as `2s` or `12f` |
| `appearance` | optional — its own Recipe, otherwise the stack's |
| `label` | optional — a `deck:Label` record |

### deck:Label

`id` and `font` are required. The copy is either the `content=` reference or the element's own text —
give both and it is refused. `size`, `color`, `align`, `block` and `padding` are optional.

```svml
<space:Frame id="deck-frame" within={vertical} left="44%" top="60%" right="98%" bottom="88%"/>
<deck:DepthStack id="deck" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical}
  frame={deck-frame} appearance={recipes.deck.stack} until={story.moment.done}>
  <deck:Card id="card-spatial" source={icon-spatial} extent={square} at={story.moment.deal-one}/>
  <deck:Card id="card-type" source={icon-type} extent={square} at={story.moment.deal-two}/>
</deck:DepthStack>
```

**Output:** `{deck.track}` — a VisualTrack, an ordinary peer of every other Track in the Film.

## Screen overlays

Effects that cover the picture rather than sit in a Frame: a flash on a cut, a vignette that holds
for a Selection, grain over the whole programme. One Track carries them all, and each child is one
effect bound to its own window.

```svml
<import as="screen" from="@hypit/screen-overlay@1"/>
```

`screen:Track` takes `id`, `canvas` and `timeline`. Its children are the effects, at least one, each
empty, each with a required `z` for stacking order and a window that is one of:

| Window | Written |
|---|---|
| The whole programme | `during="program"` |
| A Selection | `during={story.selection.x}` on an item whose Track has `timeline={speech.timeline}` |
| A Moment, for a length | `at={story.moment.x} for="12f"` on an item whose Track has `timeline={speech.timeline}` |
| An explicit span | `start="…" end="…"`, optionally against a `selection=` or `moment=` |

Lengths are `12f`, `250ms` or `1.5s`. A Selection
names one contiguous interval and a Moment names one point; author another item when an effect should
appear again.

Eleven effects are available — `Flash`, `ColorWash`, `Vignette`, `ScanLines`, `DirectionalMatte`,
`WhipVeil`, `GlitchVeil`, `Grain`, `LightLeak`, `Bokeh` and `TVStatic` — and each carries its own
required attributes, such as `color` / `intensity` / `attack` / `hold` / `decay` on a `Flash`, or
`center-x` / `center-y` / `radius-x` / `radius-y` / `softness` / `color` / `opacity` on a `Vignette`.
None have defaults: an effect states its whole shape or is refused.

```svml
<screen:Track id="effects" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical}>
  <screen:Flash during={story.selection.overlay} z="80"
    color="#ffffff" intensity="0.6" attack="2" hold="2" decay="6"/>
</screen:Track>
```

**Output:** `{effects.track}` — a VisualTrack.

## Comment stickers

Social-style comment cards placed in a Frame: an avatar, an author, the comment itself, and an
optional metadata line.

```svml
<import as="comment" from="@hypit/comment-sticker@1"/>
```

`comment:Style` is empty and takes `id`, `recipe` and `font`, all required. The recipe carries the
card's whole appearance — background, border, radius, tail, avatar, the three text rows, and the
enter/hold/exit motion — and every key has a default, so a recipe may set only what it changes.

`comment:Track` takes `id`, `canvas` and `timeline` for the complete work.

`comment:Sticker` requires `id`, `frame` and `style`, and takes the same windows as a screen overlay
above. Its copy is either the `comment=` attribute or the element's own text — both is refused. The
optional `author`, `header` and `meta` each take a string or a Text reference, `avatar` takes an
image, and there is no `z`: stacking order comes from the recipe's `stack-order`.

```svml
<comment:Style id="social" recipe={recipes.comment} font={ui-font}/>
<comment:Track id="comments" canvas={vertical} timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <comment:Sticker id="one" frame={comment-frame} style={social} avatar={viewer-avatar}
    author="@viewer" meta="Featured" during={story.selection.reaction}>
    Wait, it pinned the caption to the word, not the second.
  </comment:Sticker>
</comment:Track>
```

**Output:** `{comments.track}` — a VisualTrack.

## Combination example

All four track families together in one source file:

```svml
<import as="caption" from="@hypit/caption@1"/>
<import as="caption-fine" from="@hypit/caption-fine@1"/>
<import as="fonts" from="@hypit/fonts-open@1"/>
<import as="media" from="@hypit/media@1"/>
<import as="pipeline" from="@hypit/media-pipeline@1"/>
<import as="media-track" from="@hypit/media-track@1"/>
<import as="text" from="@hypit/typography-track@1"/>
<import as="audio" from="@hypit/audio-track@1"/>
<import as="space" from="@hypit/spatial@1"/>

<!-- Captions: primary style for all text -->
<fonts:Stack id="caption-font" family="inter" weight="700" style="normal"/>
<fonts:Stack id="title-font" family="inter" weight="900" style="normal"/>
<caption-fine:Style id="base-caption" recipe={recipes.caption.base} font={caption-font}/>
<caption:Hidden id="hidden"/>

<caption-fine:Track id="captions" document={story.caption}
  timeline={speech.timeline}>
    <caption-fine:Use style={base-caption}/>
  </caption-fine:Track>

<!-- Shared placement is an explicit edge, separate from Text appearance. -->
<space:Canvas id="vertical" width="1080" height="1920"/>
<space:Frame id="title-frame" within={vertical}
  left="6%" top="6%" right="94%" bottom="16%"/>
<space:Frame id="card-frame" within={vertical}
  left="10%" top="20%" right="90%" bottom="70%"/>

<!-- Media: one ordinary Item used editorially as B-roll -->
<pipeline:Normalize id="card-media" source={motion.video}
  video="primary-moving" audio="none" span-authority="video" frame-rate="30"/>
<media-track:Track id="cards" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical}>
  <media-track:Item media={card-media.media} frame={card-frame}
    during={story.selection.demo} appearance={recipes.media.card} motion={recipes.motion.card}/>
</media-track:Track>

<!-- Text: persistent title overlay -->
<text:Style id="title-style" recipe={recipes.text.title} font={title-font}/>
<text:Track id="titles" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <text:Area id="meaning" placement={title-frame} style={title-style} during="program">
    MEANING
  </text:Area>
</text:Track>

<!-- Audio: normalize one declared source, then place it for the complete program -->
<media:Audio id="music" src="./assets/music.wav"/>
<pipeline:Normalize id="music-media" source={music}
  video="none" audio="default" span-authority="audio" frame-rate="30"/>
<audio:Track id="music-bed" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <audio:Item source={music-media.media} during="program"
    playback="loop-end" gain="0.28" fade-in="600ms" fade-out="800ms"/>
</audio:Track>

<!-- All peer tracks feed into Film -->
<import as="sound" from="@hypit/sound@1"/>
<sound:Style id="voice-style"/>
<sound:Track id="voice" timeline={speech.timeline}>
  <sound:Use style={voice-style}/>
</sound:Track>

<film:Film id="main" canvas={vertical} timeline={speech.timeline} appearance={recipes.film.vertical}>
  <film:Track source={performance.visual}/>
  <film:Track source={voice.audio}/>
  <film:Track source={cards.visual}/>
  <film:Track source={captions.track}/>
  <film:Track source={titles.track}/>
  <film:Track source={music-bed.audio}/>
</film:Film>
```

In this example, the Recipes place the performance picture at 10, media at 40, captions at 70 and
text at 90. Higher values paint on top; the author chooses these relationships for the composition.
