# `@hypit/package-loader-node`

Loads installed Hypit packages selected by source discovery or a Runtime Profile.

The user's package manager owns installation, versions and package bytes. This loader resolves only
the requested packages. An implementation package selected by Source discovery or a Runtime
Profile may expose `hypit.activation`; the loader imports that entry and validates the contribution
boundary consumed by Hypit. It never scans the dependency tree for plugins and is not a package
manager or registry.

A data-only package may instead expose an exact Source subpath through ordinary package `exports`.
The Host can resolve that one requested file without importing `hypit.activation` or granting the
package executable authority. Package-internal relative Sources and assets remain confined to the
package root. Executable activation and Source-data lookup are deliberately separate operations.

Module dependencies declared by selected packages are loaded from ordinary installed dependencies.
Syntax, components and Runtime facets remain inert until a matching Host ABI consumes them.

Physical lookup distinguishes package identity, ESM imports, package resources and npm executables.
It does not use a CommonJS root export as evidence that a package is installed: CLI-only,
import-only and resource-only packages are valid. The active Distribution owns `@hypit/*`;
Distribution code may use upstream dependencies from the machine npm home, while project packages
continue to resolve their own dependencies from the project.

The machine home stores `<package-name>/<exact-version>/node_modules`, with the importing package's
ordinary `dependencies` selecting the version. Loading a second Distribution does not replace an
existing release. ESM, resource and executable lookup use the same selection; project dependencies
retain ordinary project ownership. There is no inventory or source-content matching.

Runtime declaration discovery may use `deferExternalDependencies` to inspect capabilities and
Managed Programs before their execution tools are prepared. Actual JavaScript imports still follow
Node resolution and must be available. A selected Profile remains a valid package configuration;
Endpoint scoping is not permission to execute an invalid or absent Provider implementation.

## Execution-owned module scopes

`NodePackageLoadOptions.importModule` lets the Host own module lifetime while package selection and
contribution validation stay here. The default uses ordinary process imports. The local execution
Host supplies a `NodeModuleScope` for each Build: selected project packages and their transitive
JavaScript dependencies receive scope-local module identities. The installed `@hypit/*` Distribution
remains shared process code. Registries and configured adapter instances are still created per Build.

`NodeModuleScope` uses Node resolution/loading hooks and transpiles scope-owned TypeScript/TSX. Its CommonJS
bridge has a scope-owned module cache, Node-style named-export discovery and synchronous evaluation;
Node's VM dynamic-import support is enabled only for the execution carrier. Public paths such as
`import.meta.url`, `__filename` and relative asset reads remain real filesystem locations. Module
identity URLs are internal names; no copied source directory is created. Closing a scope drops its
live lookup and CommonJS table; the Host retires an empty carrier to release Node's ESM cache.

This is trusted execution, not a sandbox. Builtins, native libraries and process-global state
(including `process.cwd()` and `process.env`) remain shared. Existing module bindings do not change
under an active Build; a file or dependency first
read later uses ordinary filesystem semantics. Scoped loading does not make a project tree immutable.

## Dependency installation options

A Distribution package may declare `hypit.dependencyInstallEnv` in its package.json, keyed by its
ordinary direct external dependency names. Each value is an environment-variable map passed to that
dependency's explicit npm installation. For example, an owner can disable an SDK's automatic asset
download and prepare that asset through its ManagedProgram instead. Options do not propagate to
unrelated installations or the caller's process. Conflicting values from selected packages fail;
no package wins by discovery order. They are command inputs, not a second dependency inventory,
readiness record, or new version system. Project packages remain owned by their package manager.
