# `@hypit/temporal-markup`

Shared SVML author-time projection helpers for `@hypit/temporal`. The Surface lowers authored
Selection, Segment, Moment or explicit clock expressions to ordinary Instant projections and Window
composition. A domain consumer receives the projected values and the shared Timeline; it does not
locate Script words or infer a semantic source inside its renderer.

The package exports `createTemporalWindowProjection`, `createTemporalInstantProjection`,
`resolveTemporalContext`, attribute vocabulary, and the exact duration/instant parsers. These are helpers for component
Surfaces, not standalone author tags or a new Track.

The editing behavior is specified in [Author-directed time editing](EDITING.md).
It separates direct bindings, durations, and explicit offsets from derived results, with a precise
write target for each supported gesture.

## Time context

A Track Surface accepts `timeline={program.timeline}`. Resolve it with
`resolveTemporalContext({ element, resolveReference })` and pass that context to each temporal
projection helper. Wire `context.timeline.ref` directly into the component Fragment's Timeline port.
Preserve the projections' returned records, components and fragments.

The context contains one required `timeline` reference. Program time and Script references both
project against it. Pure animation uses a zero-Take Timeline with an authored extent. Script events
use the anchors provided by its placed Takes. Drawing Producers receive that same Timeline and the
projected Instants/Windows; they need no Script parser or separate time-range input.

## Window forms

A Surface using the shared Window vocabulary accepts one complete form:

| Authored attributes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `during="program"` | The complete program Window. |
| `during={story.segment.opening}` | A Segment's Window. |
| `during={story.selection.proof}` | A Selection's Window, including its authored endpoint affinity. |
| `at="2s" for="8f"` | Start two seconds into the program and last eight frames. |
| `at={story.moment.reveal} for="8f"` | Start at a Moment and last eight program frames. |
| `until={story.moment.reveal} for="250ms"` | End at a Moment after a span of 250 milliseconds. |
| `start="program.start" end="moment.cue" moment={story.moment.reveal}` | Compose independently authored endpoints. |

Do not combine forms: `during="program" until={...}` is not shorthand for a shortened program.
Use explicit `start` and `end` for that relationship. Expressions can reference `program.start`,
`program.end`, `selection.start`, `selection.end`, `segment.start`, `segment.end` or `moment.cue`.
Bind the corresponding `selection`, `segment` or `moment` reference attribute when an expression
uses it. An endpoint may also be an absolute duration from program start, such as `1.5s`.

Offsets use an explicit sign and duration, for example `selection.start - 2f`. Frames and milliseconds
are integers (`8f`, `250ms`); seconds may be fractional (`1.5s`). Projection preserves the expression
and its authority. Invalid or out-of-program results are errors rather than silently clipped time.

## Instant forms

An Instant consumer has a different job: an event or activation with one temporal point.

| Authored attributes | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `at={story.moment.reveal}` | The authored Moment. |
| `at={story.selection.proof} boundary="start"` | An explicitly chosen Selection boundary. |
| `at={story.segment.opening} boundary="end"` | An explicitly chosen Segment boundary. |
| `at="2.6s"` | An authored event 2.6 seconds from program start. |
| `instant="program.start + 8f"` | A projected clock expression. |

The domain component decides what happens after that point. An answer may remain visible, a Sequence
may replace its member, or a motion may run according to its own authored schedule. Instant projection
does not impose the event's visible duration. A component whose public role requires a Script Moment
can deliberately admit only that form; consumers need not expose unrelated temporal options.

## Component boundary

The Surface supplies an author-facing `subjectId` for the actual item whose time is being projected,
separately from graph-qualified operation ids. The graph wires the resulting Instant or Window and
Timeline into the consumer. Keep projection outside the domain Producer: it consumes resolved
time and implements its own schedule or state, while the shared temporal protocol retains where that
time came from. An outer lifetime and child activations are separate inputs when a component persists
between events.

Script's delimited `@{...}` Selection and Moment syntax belong to `@hypit/script`; media playback belongs
to `@hypit/media-track`; a graphic component's reveal or preset semantics belong to that component.

## Independently bound endpoints

For a Window whose endpoints refer to different semantic sources, use `start-source` and
`end-source`. The expression still states the kind and boundary; each binding supplies that source:

```svml
<example:Item start-source={story.segment.next} start="segment.start"
  end-source={story.segment.previous} end="segment.end"/>
```

This describes an overlapping physical interval without authoring a backwards Script Selection.
The same endpoint bindings accept Selections or Moments with their corresponding expressions.
`segment`, `selection` and `moment` remain convenient shared bindings when both expressions use the
same source. Explicit expressions retain local parameter writeback; these bindings do not move the
referenced Script anchors when the expression's offset is edited.
