# `@hypit/elevenlabs-speech`

Exact model contract and author Surface for ElevenLabs Voice Design.

`eleven_ttv_v3` creates an ordinary audio voice reference from a natural-language description of
20 to 1000 characters and an authored speech sample of 100 to 1000 characters. The service returns
several candidate previews; the Surface exposes the primary member of the shared `GeneratedAudioSet`
as `<id>.reference`.

It contains no API URL, credential, retry, queue or ElevenLabs wire encoding. Those belong to a
Runtime Endpoint such as `@hypit/provider-hypihub`.

```xml
<import as="eleven" from="@hypit/elevenlabs-speech@1"/>

<eleven:VoiceDesign id="host" speech={story.segment.voiceSample.speech}>
  A clear young woman with a grounded, confident conversational delivery.
</eleven:VoiceDesign>
```

`host.reference` is not a special identity record. It is a normal audio Resource, so the same
accepted reference can be supplied anywhere an audio reference is accepted.

Official API reference: <https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-voice/design>

The Source import selects author syntax and exact model semantics only. The Runtime Profile
independently selects the Provider that fulfils the capability.
