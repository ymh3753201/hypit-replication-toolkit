# `@hypit/source`

The smallest source bootstrap shared by Author and Run compilation.

It recognizes exactly one mandatory bounded Header:

```xml
<?svml using="@hypit/markup@1"?>
```

The Header selects an exact trusted Frontend. There is no suffix dispatch and no default parser.
The package masks the Header while preserving UTF-16 source offsets and line breaks, but does not recognize imports,
XML, Script, Recipes, Run syntax or domain Types. Those belong to the selected Frontend.
