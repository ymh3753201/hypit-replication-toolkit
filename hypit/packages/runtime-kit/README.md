# `@hypit/hypit/runtime-kit`

Host facets for the two environmental choices a Local Runtime Profile may select:

* an Endpoint implements external capabilities;
* a Credential Store resolves explicit credential references.

External packages use this public subpath from their `@hypit/hypit` development dependency. The built
package's `hypit.activation` entry exports a default package contribution with
`format: "hypit.node-package@1"` and the declared `hostFacets`.

For a Provider, `createRuntimeEndpointAdapterFacet({ use, activate })` advertises its owner-scoped
package name. `activate(context)` reads `instance`, `pool`, and the package's own `config`, then
returns `{ endpoint }` from `defineEndpointPackage`; it can also return `program` and `diagnose`.
The configuration helpers parse values and CredentialRefs. Activation describes the deployment;
credential resolution, remote invocation, and Managed Program startup happen through their Runtime
operations. Installing the same package in another project preserves its `use` name.

```json
{
  "endpoints": {
    "art.personal": {
      "use": "@studio/provider-art",
      "config": { "apiKey": { "store": "os", "key": "art.personal" } }
    }
  }
}
```

This is a Profile fragment: the Provider defines its actual config fields, and the complete Profile
selects the `os` Credential Store as well. Separate instances can use separate accounts. A binding
names the chosen instance when several offer the same capability. The default pool identity is the
instance; declare a shared pool only for a real shared account, deployment, or compute quota.

Each adapter is addressed by its kind and `use` name. A package advertises that name through a Host
facet; the Runtime Profile selects it explicitly. Installing a package does not activate it.

Endpoint activation returns one Endpoint and may also describe a Managed Program such as a warm local
WhisperX process. Credential adapters validate configuration before opening a store. Active Resource
storage belongs to the Runtime implementation, while project Build Result repositories use the
separate `@hypit/build-result-kit` boundary. Runtime Kit knows no Provider, filesystem, database or
video package by name.

`ManagedProgram.installation.prepareBeforeStart` lets a Provider reconcile its installed environment
before a cold start, even when the installation probe already passes. The declared commands use the
Provider's ordinary package manager. `programs prepare` runs the declared installation independently
of process startup; `programs up` also checks its resources when the process is already healthy.
The installation probe covers the owner's selected execution resources, while the process probe
reports service readiness. Cold reconciliation still applies only before starting a new process.
Runtime does not name models, inspect source files or infer implementation versions. Preparation
may acquire resources; execution must consume already prepared resources and report what is missing.
`ManagedProgramCommand.label` optionally names a command's purpose for progress and log headings.
It is display text supplied by the Program owner, not a phase to persist or interpret. Runtime
reports generic process/probe facts; the service itself owns domain-specific progress in its logs.
