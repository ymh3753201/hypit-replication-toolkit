# `@hypit/media-track`

The Track Surface accepts `timeline={program.timeline}`. The same Timeline supports authored
positions and, where prepared Takes supply evidence, Script Selections and Moments. Shared `at`
inputs accept a Moment or a time such as `2s`; `at` with `for` produces a Window where required.
[Performance](../performance/README.md) separately obtains existing footage and source positions from Timeline.

Place images, prepared video or compositable surfaces over the semantic timeline. B-roll is a common
use: the picture can illustrate a phrase while the A-roll's speech continues.
Media Items own independently timed pictures;
a Sequence owns one visual slot whose Members replace each other through Handoffs.

The Markup Track takes `canvas` and `timeline`. Its Surface projects
authored Selections, Moments, Segments or clock expressions into Windows and Instants. The component
consumes those projected times with Frames, media and appearance; its Fragment receives the same Timeline.

Moving media enters after [normalization](../media-pipeline/README.md), with the intended streams and
frame clock already selected. Still images use their actual intrinsic Extent. Placement, fitting,
sampling and motion remain separate authored choices.

## Present existing Timeline footage

[Performance](../performance/README.md) obtains existing footage from Timeline and applies broad
and local Use rules. Use Media Items here for independently supplied assets and playback choices.
Both reuse the same geometry and fitting capabilities.

## Place the frame, then fit its contents

An Item or Sequence owns an outer destination `frame`. Each sampled source has a fitted content
rectangle calculated from its intrinsic extent and its fit Recipe. Border and padding reduce the
fitting area inside the outer Frame. Source dimensions stay factual; the calculated rectangle can
be smaller or larger than the fitting area.

[Spatial](../spatial/README.md#destination-and-fitted-content) owns the seven fit modes, the two
alignment points, pixel offsets and bounded/free placement. `frame-x` / `frame-y` are alignment
fractions in that fitting area. Move the whole visual by changing the `frame` reference; choose
which part of the picture is visible through the fit and content alignment.

The appearance Recipe separates the outer presentation from the sampled picture:

| Properties | What they affect |
| --- | --- |
| `stack-order` | Absolute visual stacking of the Item or Sequence; required |
| `clip` | Outer clipping: `frame` (default), `rounded`, or `none` |
| `radius` | Pixel radius when `clip: rounded`; half a square Frame's side gives a circle |
| `padding` | Fitting inset, as quoted pixel values: `"12"`, `"8 12"`, or `"8 12 16 12"` |
| `border-width`, `border-style`, `border-color` | Border inside the outer Frame; a positive width requires a color |
| `shadows` | Frame shadows, as quoted `x y blur spread color` entries separated by semicolons |
| `frame-paint` | Solid or gradient backing behind the content |
| `fit`, alignment and fit offsets | The scaled source's rectangle |
| `opacity`, `blur`, `brightness`, `contrast`, `saturation` | The sampled picture, independently of frame decoration |

For example, this is a rounded card with an inset picture and a painted backing:

```svs
media.card {
  stack-order: 40;
  fit: contain;
  clip: rounded;
  radius: 24;
  padding: "12";
  border-width: 2;
  border-color: #B9A88B;
  frame-paint: #25332D;
  shadows: "0 8 20 0 #00000055";
}
```

The outer size includes the border; border and padding both reduce the fitting area. The clip
follows the outer Frame, so a smaller contained picture may retain square corners inside a rounded
card. A rounded picture with a flush edge uses a Frame matching its displayed aspect. `clip: none`
allows source overflow; fitting alone supplies no mask. An authored spatial Path can be bound to
an Item or Sequence with `clip={path}` in place of the Recipe's clip choice. Path coordinates are in
Canvas pixels.

A `motion` Recipe transforms the framed unit, including its backing and decoration. `Sampling`
transforms the fitted source inside it, around the source rectangle's center. It accepts `zoom`,
pixel `x` / `y`, degree `rotate`, and `easing`, at `start`, `end`, or intermediate percentages. Supply
keys spanning start to end. Sampling runs after fitting and is not constrained by `fit-constraint`;
a deliberate pan or rotation may reveal the backing or lower layers.

## Author Items and replacement Sequences

These excerpts assume the imports, named assets, normalized media, Frames, Extents, Script,
Timeline and Recipes are already declared:

```svml
<media-track:Track id="coverage" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical}>
  <media-track:Item image={photo} extent={photo-extent} frame={full-frame}
    during={story.selection.example} appearance={recipes.media.still}/>
  <media-track:Item media={clip-media.media} frame={full-frame}
    during={story.selection.proof} appearance={recipes.media.clip}/>
</media-track:Track>
```

One Item selects exactly one direct source form (`image` + `extent`, prepared `media`, or `surface`)
or declares ordered `Paint`/`Layer` children. The current Surface has no raw `video` attribute.
Appearance owns stack order, fit, clipping and source sampling; a `motion` Recipe owns lifecycle
movement. `Sampling` children can move the sampled content inside the Frame independently.

```svml
<media-track:Track id="cards" timeline={speech.timeline} canvas={vertical}>
  <media-track:Sequence id="steps" frame={card-frame} appearance={recipes.media.card}
    until={story.selection.demo} until-boundary="end">
    <media-track:Member id="one" image={first} extent={card-extent}
      at={story.moment.first}/>
    <media-track:Member id="two" image={second} extent={card-extent}
      at={story.moment.second}/>
    <media-track:Handoff id="one-two" from="one" transition={recipes.transition.cards}/>
  </media-track:Sequence>
</media-track:Track>
```

Members have ordered activation Instants; the next activation ends the preceding logical phase,
and the Sequence has an explicit terminal Instant. Each adjacent pair needs a Handoff, including
an explicit `cut` when no blended transition is intended. `from` names the outgoing Member; its
successor is the incoming Member. A Handoff's duration and boundary ratio place the visual transition
around that logical boundary without moving the semantic event.

For layered content, `Paint` and `Layer` children draw in Source order inside the shared Frame. Give
each Layer its own fit/sample Recipe. A Member appearance override selects its source fit, sampling
and frame paint; the Sequence still owns the outer Frame, clip, padding, border, shadow, motion and
stack order. Separate Items supply independently placed Frames.

An Item or Member can select audio using `source-audio`: `content` for its direct source, or a child
Layer id for layered content. This is opt-in. `Sound` can instead attach normalized audio to Item
`at="enter"` / `at="exit"`, or to a Sequence `handoff="one-two"`. The Track publishes `.visual` and
`.program`, plus `.audio` when sound is present; Film must include the desired peer outputs.

## Item windows and source playback

The Item's projected Window determines when it is active in the program. A timed sample's Recipe
separately controls which source frames it occupies there. `playback` defaults to `once-start`:

| Value | Source occupancy inside the Window |
| --- | --- |
| `once-start` | Play at native rate from the source start. Truncate if the Window is shorter; draw no source after it ends if the Window is longer. |
| `once-end` | Align native playback to the Window end. Use the source tail if the Window is shorter; leave the initial excess unoccupied if longer. |
| `hold-start` | Play from the start, then hold the last source frame over any remaining Window. |
| `hold-end` | Align playback to the end, holding the first source frame over any initial excess. |
| `loop-start` / `loop-end` | Repeat at native rate, aligning the loop phase to the start or end. |
| `stretch` | Retime the selected source range across the full Window. |

`trim-start` and `trim-end` are a pair of integer source-frame boundaries, with an exclusive end.
Omit both to use the full source. The playback rules apply to the trimmed range when present.
For `stretch`, the source-frame advance is `sourceLength / targetLength`. For native playback, moving
media has already been normalized to Timeline's frame rate, so one program frame advances one
source frame. These are source sampling choices; they do not move a Selection's semantic boundaries.

A two-second Item can use the beginning of a four-second generated clip without requesting a
model-invalid two-second generation. Conversely, an Item active longer than its source must choose
whether a return to the layer below, a hold, a loop or retiming is intended. No mode is universally
correct for B-roll. Extending a Window with `once-start` does not extend the underlying video.

Durationless still images refuse `playback`, `trim-start` and `trim-end`. Their spatial placement and
Item Window are sufficient. A static B-roll picture does not need conversion to a generated clip.

Visual and source-audio projections remain separate. Selecting source audio applies the corresponding
sampling policy to that audio; a held visual frame does not synthesize held sound. A silent B-roll
layer can cover a speaking Track while the latter's audio continues unchanged.

For adjacent semantic Items that should have no uncovered pause, author touching Selection boundaries
using Script affinity. Also inspect opacity transitions and source exhaustion: touching Windows alone
do not guarantee opaque visual coverage.
