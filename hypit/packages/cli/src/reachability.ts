 * Whether anything *consumes* a declaration cannot answer this. An Author Source has no targets, so
 * "nothing needs this" has no meaning there, and a package's own expansion consumes its own
 * intermediate steps — a generated picture is read by the step that picks the primary image, which
 * makes the generation look used even when the picture it produces is read by nobody.
 *
 * A Run Source does have targets, and planning already prunes to what they reach. So the question
 * that can be answered is the one that matters: this Run declares the generation and will not run
 * it. Either nothing needs it, a target is missing, or an explicit Candidate supplies the Output.
